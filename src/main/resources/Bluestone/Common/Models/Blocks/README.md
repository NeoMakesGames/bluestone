# Block Models

Place the following model files in this directory:

## Bluestone Wire Models
- `BluestoneWireOff.blockymodel` - Model for unpowered wire
- `BluestoneWireOn.blockymodel` - Model for powered wire

## Bluestone Switch Models
- `BluestoneSwitchOff.blockymodel` - Model for switch in OFF position
- `BluestoneSwitchOn.blockymodel` - Model for switch in ON position

## Model Creation
Models can be created using:
- Hytale Model Maker (official tool)
- Blockbench (community tool with Hytale export support)

For the wire, a simple flat cross pattern works well.
For the switch, a lever or pillar shape is recommended.
